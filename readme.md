Description:

Welcome in my another project, it's simple casino game aldo known as "One-handed bandit".
Actualy it is my first project with OOP techniques, so there are many comments in code. 
I was never worked with classes, constructors and closures, so I was struggling a little, but behind the struggle there is also excitement because I am moving forward with programming :)

Technologies i used in project:

HTML5, CSS3, Vanillia Java-Script with OOP paradigms.
